 <div class="Aboutme">
 	<p>Hello, and welcome to my page! I am confident, hard-working, and energetic, driven by a desire to learn, explore, and make the world a better place. Currently between high school and University, I am doing a gap year working for an MP in the House of Commons, a unique experience which has allowed me to gain a deep practical understanding of the workings of both British and international politics. My ambition is to enter the field of either finance, diplomancy, or entrepeneurship after my studies, though the truth is that I never want to stop learning in other ways. I am fascinated by economics, business, politics, law, and computer science, and often write on these subjects. I would love for you to explore my work on the <a href="blog"><i>blog</i></a> section.<br><img id="img-circle" src="ProfilePicture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" align="center" ></p>
 	<p id="Aimsandplans">At university I will study a mix of economics, politics / international relations, and philosophy, all of which will give me a broad understanding of the current problems we are facing, but also the ability to think critically and react to future problems. To build on my degree, I love to travel, read, and view things visually at museums across the world. Locally, I’ve been the Chair of the Reigate Youth Council, I am standing as a Councillor for Redhill, and I am active in the local community, having read poetry in front of 2000 people at the Great-War remembrance evening, for example. If you’d like to learn more about my work, I’d encourage you to fully explore the website, and to reach out to me for any further enquiries. -Adam<br></p>
