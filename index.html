 <div class="Aboutme">
 	<p>Welcome! I Am Adam Lehodey, an exuberant 16-year-old based in London, UK, currently in my first year of Sixth-Form. My interests include Computing, business and languages; you can be sure to find me doing one of these, whether it be ‘Hablando Español’ or creating new websites! These integral parts of my life help contribute to my outgoing, extroverted and dynamic personality which will bring energy and life to all environments. I am very active in the local community, constantly taking part in Charity events, the Student Union and making a difference as a Local Youth Councillor, where I always use my strengths to help raise awareness for problems affecting the youth, fundraise and help organise events such as ‘The Big Youth Debate’, attended by over 40 people and the Mayor.<img id="img-circle" src="Profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" align="center" ></p>
 	<p id="Aimsandplans">I am studying hard to ensure success at my A-Levels - Mathematics, Computing and Spanish - and seek to continue my study in either Computing or Business at Degree Level – looking to study at one of the best Russell Group Universities, including Imperial, Oxbridge, and LSE. I strive to deliver effective communication and team-work, and have been called a ‘natural leader’ as a result, along with my determination and excitement in subjects, where I achieved 10A* GCSE grades. An example of my leadership was the Canon ‘Make the Grade’ Enterprise project, where I lead my team to 1st place out of 5. My organisation and ability to work effectively under pressure, combined with my vibrant, vital personality and my hard work are skills I will continue to demonstrate to achieve my aims of studying at a top university and improve further.</p>
