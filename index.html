 <div class="Aboutme">
 	<p>Welcome! I Am Adam Lehodey, an exuberant 16-year-old based in London, UK, currently in my first year of Sixth-Form. Computing, Business, Languages and networking are things which I absolutely love doing, you can be sure to find me doing one of these, whether it be ‘Hablando Español’ or creating new websites! These integral parts of my life contribute to my outgoing, extroverted and dynamic personality which will bring energy and life to all environments. I am very active in the local community, constantly taking part in Charity events, the Student Union and making a difference as one of the Chairs at my Local Youth Council, where I use my strengths to ensure we excel in raising awareness for problems affecting the youth, fundraise and help organise events such as ‘The Big Youth Debate’, attended by over 40 people and the Mayor.<br><img id="img-circle" src="Profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" align="center" ></p>
 	<p id="Aimsandplans">I am studying hard to ensure success at my A-Levels - Mathematics, Computing, Spanish and French - seeking to continue my study in Computer Science at Degree Level – looking to study at one of the best Russell Group Universities, including UCL, Imperial and Oxford. I strive to deliver effective communication and team-work, and have been called a ‘natural leader’ as a result, along with my determination and excitement in subjects, where I achieved 10A* GCSE grades. An example of my leadership was the Canon ‘Make the Grade’ Enterprise project, where I lead my team to 1st place out of 5. My vibrant, vital personality and my hard work are skills I will continue to demonstrate to achieve my aims of studying at a top university and improve further.
