 <div class="Aboutme">
 	<p>Welcome to my website! This is a page where I blog about topics that interest me and offer services such as tutoring and web-design. Having recently completed my A-Levels, I am currently undertaking a gap year where I aim to expand my understanding of the world through reading, travel, and internships. I am eager to gain new experiences and perspectives on topics which interest me; economics, business, politics, law, languages, computer-science. If you are interested in reading on trends and insights within these topics, please check out the ‘blog section’. The study of these subjects has been an integral part of my life over the past few years - whether it be through ‘hablando español’ or debating on tax reform. They are topics which I will explore in greater depth when I will attend a top University in the coming year, but I also seek to gain a practical understanding through work before then.<br><img id="img-circle" src="ProfilePicture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" align="center" ></p>
 	<p id="Aimsandplans">I am also committed to local service, and have been a member of the Reigate and Banstead Youth Council (which I later chaired) since October 2015. Some stand-out moments include organising our ‘Big Youth Debate’ and reading war-poetry in front of an audience of 2000 people at the Reigate Great-War remembrance evening 100 years on. I am also involved in local politics, and thus have been able to build a rapport with many local people. I am always keen to get involved locally, so if there is a local event that you believe I would be interested in, please do contact me via the ‘Contact me’ session. All of these things are what have contributed to my vibrant and eccentric personality, and if you want to learn more, please look at the ‘Portfolio’ section. Enjoy my website!</p>
