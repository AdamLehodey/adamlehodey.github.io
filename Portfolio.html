	<div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">I am a first-year Sixth-Former based in London, UK, currently undertaking my A-Level studies. As you most-likely learnt from the homepage, I love languages and computing, and am inspired and motivated to do well as a result of this. I am very fortunate to have been able to travel a lot of Europe and North America because of this, something which inspires to always think with an open and positive mind-set. I ensure I always have a smile on my face, and persevere at all times! If I sound like the sort of person you’d like to work with, definitely look at my services section, where I offer professional services including Web Design, Tutoring and more!<br><br>Another thing emphasised on the homepage is how I use my exuberant, positive personality and apply it to the things I do to deliver exceptional work. This can be seen in all the work I do, one example being a Social Action Fundraising project I led, supporting ‘Rape Crisis Surrey and Sussex’, where my dedication and positivity helped bring the team together, assisting us in raising awareness and almost £2000 in 2 weeks for the Charity.  In regards to my A-Level subjects, I not only put the effort in to succeed, I truly enjoy diving deeper into my subjects, especially computing where it is incredible to picture the true capacity and complexity of Computers. My aim is to keep up the hard-work and make sure I consolidate the A*’s I need to attend one of the top Universities, especially UCL or Imperial.<p></div>

	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2><h3>Reigate and Banstead Borough Council</h3><p>Volunteering at the Reigate and Banstead Youth Council has enabled me to gain experience in helping the elderly and volunteering at food shelters, which has allowed me to gain strong communication skills. I have had many responsibilities including creating stands and displays for our campaigns, being involved and organising a litter-pick, selling tickets to events hosted by the council such as ‘Star for a Night Event’ and marketing the Youth Council to schools.</p><h3>Redhill Library</h3>My role included helping clients by using my outstanding product knowledge to recommend books, DVD’s, and CD’s. – also helping find items and assisting with check-outs. I was trusted to generate sales for library events such as cake sales, doing so through my enthusiasm and passion. To deliver effective customer service, it was important to be a team-player and detail-orientated.  Excellent communication skills, time management, and energy were critical skills I utilised.<br><br></div>
