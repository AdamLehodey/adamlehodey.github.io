I have had many responsibilities including creating stands and displays for our campaigns, being involved and organising a litter-pick, selling tickets to events hosted by the council such as ‘Star for a Night Event’ and marketing the Youth Council to schools.</p><h3>Redhill Library</h3>My role included helping clients by using my outstanding product knowledge to recommend books, DVD’s, and CD’s. – also helping find items and assisting with check-outs. I was trusted to generate sales for library events such as cake sales, doing so through my enthusiasm and passion. To deliver effective customer service, it was important to be a team-player and detail-orientated.  Excellent communication skills, time management, and energy were critical skills I utilised.<br><br></div>
