	<img id="arboles" src="Code.jpg"><h1 class="Title">PORTFOLIO</h1></div>

	<div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">I am a first-year Sixth-Former based in London, UK, currently undertaking my A-Level studies. As you most-likely learnt from the homepage, I love languages and computing, and am inspired and motivated to do well as a result of this. I am very fortunate to have been able to travel a lot of Europe and North America because of this, something which inspires to always think with an open and positive mind-set. I ensure I always have a smile on my face, and persevere at all times! If I sound like the sort of person you’d like to work with, definitely look at my services section, where I offer professional services including Web Design, Tutoring and more!<br><br>Another thing emphasised on the homepage is how I use my exuberant, positive personality and apply it to the things I do to deliver exceptional work. This can be seen in all the work I do, one example being a Social Action Fundraising project I led, supporting ‘Rape Crisis Surrey and Sussex’, where my dedication and positivity helped bring the team together, assisting us in raising awareness and almost £2000 in 2 weeks for the Charity.  In regards to my A-Level subjects, I not only put the effort in to succeed, I truly enjoy diving deeper into my subjects, especially computing where it is incredible to picture the true capacity and complexity of Computers. My aim is to keep up the hard-work and make sure I consolidate the A*’s I need to attend one of the top Universities, especially UCL or Imperial.<p></div>

	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">WORK EXPERIENCE</h2><h3>Boots UK</h3><p>I am a valued team member at Boots UK and know the importance of excellent communication, using my out-going and enthusiastic personality to deliver fantastic customer service for every customer. I have been described as ‘bringing a positive spirit to the team’ due to the effort and dedication I put into everything, something which motivates me to work there and makes it a pleasure to work with my team!<br><br>
	Working here, I’ve understood the corporate structure and gained commercial awareness about it is critical to adapt in a fast-paced business environment. This understanding means I am quick to react to changing situations and apply this to other aspects of my work and social life, such as adapting to groups and environments well and using it in my programming by completing tasks in a structured and approached way – this can be seen on this website and on my other Github projects. Overall, my Work at Boots has allowed me to consolidate my communication skills and team-work, but most importantly has shown me the importance of persistence, hard work and effort, and how they always deliver excellent results. Working at Boots is very enjoyable as a result of this, and it is certainly something I apply and will continue to apply to my studies and other aspects of my life.
	</p><p class="Quote">“The only way to do great work is to love what you do, and it is apparent that Adam loves his job. Never has a room lit up more, than when Adam walks in!” – Bhageera Sivakumaran, Colleague.</p><h3>UCL Finance Spring School</h3><p>During February of 2018, I was fortunate enough to attend a week-long insight week into what studying economics at one of the world’s leading Universities entails. We all worked on group project surrounding a specific Investment bank (Lloyd’s Bank), where it was imperative that I showed excellent communication skills, I often lead the group and collected all the ideas, but also presented our groups ideas to the other groups. The willingness and desire to learn more about Economics and Journalism was also a key skill I demonstrated – specifically learning about research skills and using the right sources for what you’re researching, and how this is applied to the financial sector.</p>
	<h3>Reigate and Banstead Youth Council</h3><p>As one of the Chairs of the Reigate and Banstead Youth Council, I have gained strong experience in leadership and the importance of community work, including helping the elderly and volunteering at food shelters. It is shocking how close some of the issues that exist are to us, and has without a doubt allowed me to develop personally and feel better linked within my community. I have had many responsibilities including creating stands and displays for our campaigns, being involved and organising a litter-pick, selling tickets to events hosted by the council such as ‘Star for a Night Event’ and marketing the Youth Council to schools.<br><br>The next aim that I am leading, along with the other Chair, will be to tackle Drug and Substance abuse among Young People, working closely with the Charity ‘Surrey Drug and Alcohol Care’. I am also using my Computing and Digital skills to benefit the Youth Council, managing the Social Media aspects and having attended a session to show the elderly the power of computers, all in a simple and understandable way. Being part of the community is one of the most important aspects of living in an area and allows you to get to know others and make a difference, and is something I have and will always continue to do.</p><h3>Redhill Library</h3>I volunteered at my local library - Redhill Library - for almost a year, where I used my Computer skills to help improve the library in many ways including creating a system to organise events being hosted at the library as well as creating beautiful displays about the books and library. I was trusted to generate sales for library events such as cake sales, doing so through my enthusiasm and passion. I really got stuck in and learnt so much about time management and learning about the product, and it was overall a great experience!<br><br></div>
	
	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS</h2><h3>Deputy Head Boy at Previous School</h3><p>One of my greatest achievements at Secondary school is being selected as one of the Head-Boys by the Senior Leadership team. I worked very closely with the other Head Boys and Girls and a standout moment was fundraising for ‘Children in Need’, where I used problem-solving skills to come up with ideas and help raise almost £2000 for the charity, exceeding our goal of £1500. The strong connection I shared with all the staff meant that I was trusted to create the final leavers video along with the other Head Boys and girls, and it came out as a huge success!<br><br>I carried out many speeches and assemblies and used my confidence to represent our school in a very positive way, something I a still proud of and will continue to use my confidence to make a positive impact. Leadership and public speaking were some of the key skills this role helped me consolidate, and I gained not only great friendships, but also allowed me to gain experience in leading societies and hosting and organising many large events.</p><h3>UK Senior Mathematics Challenge – Silver Award</h3><p>I was one of three people in my year of 300 maths students to achieve a silver certificate at the UK Senior Maths Challenge 2017 and was extremely pleased with my achievement! I definitely look to score gold next year!</p><h3>Duke of Edinburgh Awards – Bronze-Gold</h3>The Gold Duke of Edinburgh award involves 18 months of Volunteering, Sport and Skills, as well as a long expedition abroad. It’s challenging for many, however that is one of the things which drove me to take part! Having completed Bronze through to Gold, which I am currently doing, the expedition is certainly one of the most memorable experiences and involves working together to navigate the winding paths and forests of an unfamiliar location. The ability to work closely with others and once again do something to build stronger connections with others, as well as challenging myself, is what drove me to want to complete the Duke of Edinburgh challenge. This has not only helped me work very well with others, but also increased my determination to complete things to the highest standard as I know it is possible!</p><h3>Canon Make the Grade Project</h3><p>Involved creating an ad to attract more people to Canon cameras. As group leader, I led, managed deadlines and brought the group together, where we did superbly and won 2nd place.</p><h3>Teaching Languages - St John’s School </h3><p>I delivered fun and enjoyable Spanish language lessons to Students at St John’s School every fortnight. I thought of all ideas and material to communicate well with younger people.<p class="Quote">“I worked closely with Adam in languages and witnessed his hard-work, reliability and creativity. He always made others laugh in a positive way and put his heart and soul into all his projects which is why they are such a success.” – Holly Rush, Friend of Adam.</p></p><br></div>

	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">SKILLS AND INTERESTS</h2><h3>Languages</h3><p>The way we use language to communicate and interact has never failed to amaze me, and I am constantly reading novels and publications such as The Economist and WIRED to see different perspectives on events. In addition, linguistics masterclasses I’ve attended at Cambridge and King’s college have also shown how language can be manipulated to make current affairs (US Gun Control, African Issues such as Corruption in South Africa) fit an agenda.</p><h3>Computing and Mathematics</h3><p>In addition to my qualification in Computing, I am tech-savvy and learnt to use languages including Java, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and more! My interest means I can quickly learn to use new equipment like tills, etc. Also I am strong at maths and won Silver Award at UK Senior Maths Challenge in 2017, and Silver the previous year too.</p><p class="Quote">“In Computer Science, Adam has shown himself to be a highly motivated student with great ability and insight into the Computer Science discipline. During his studies, Adam has developed a strong grasp of programming with an intuitive understanding of algorithm design. He has spent a considerable amount of time outside of lessons practising his programming skills to an advanced level.  Adam has been developing in Java using the NetBeans IDE. He has shown a keen interest and dedication throughout the course and strives to achieve an excellent understanding of the various topics within the course.  Adam is an amazing student and I am always very interested to see what he does next.” - Julie Hodgson, Computer Science Teacher.</p><h3>Web Design</h3><p>The website you are currently viewing is my best example of web-design, and was created and designed fully by me. Not only does the website look fantastic on desktop computers, I have also taken into mind the fact that 51% of internet traffic is mobile, and so have fully optimised the site for mobile and tablets. I have incorporated a high level of security into the site and have added live elements including JavaScript, CSS3 and PHP elements for things such as the contact form, but am always improving my web design coding! I created this entirely as a side project however in a couple of months, and am very pleased that you are now able to read this online!</p><h3>Music and Drama</h3><p>I played in the Orchestra and am passionate about music. This supported me in gaining confidence, team-work, and effective communication skills.</p><br><br></div>
