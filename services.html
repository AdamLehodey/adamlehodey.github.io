	<div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">Need some extra support on your Mathematics or English? Want to get ahead of the class and challenge yourself? You're in luck, as Adam Lehodey's Tutoring allows you to do just that. I am offering tutoring services within the Reigate, Redhill, and Horley areas for GCSE and A-Level. What differentiates me is my enthusiasm and energy, which no doubt makes a difference when studying a subject, and the fact that I am student myself, and so can offer helpful exam tips and more!</p></div>


	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">TUTORING</h2><p>The subjects I offer tutoring for are as follow.<br><br><i>GCSE Level</i>Mathematics, English Literature and Language, French, Spanish, Computer Science, Business Studies.<br><br><i>A-Level</i>Mathematics, Computer Science, French, Spanish<br><br>The lessons will include problem sheets, time to discuss individual difficulties, questions for the Tutor, further activities, and anything else that will aid learning! I have achieved top GCSE and A-Level grades in all these subjects (10A* at GCSE, A*A*AA at A-Level), and will approach teaching in a fun, interesting, yet structured way to ensure exam success!<br>The rate for a one and a half hour session is £30. For more information or to book a session, please contact me via the <a href="contact"><i>Contact Me</i></a> page.</p><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">LANGUAGES TUTORING</h2><p>Languages are one my favourites things, especially as I’m fluent in all three of Français, English and Español. This makes me very qualified to teach languages including French and Spanish, or English to foreign or domestic students who wish to improve their language skills. I am currently undertaking A-Levels in both French and Spanish, and have been speaking both French and English since birth, meaning that my services offer the ability to speak with a true French person and understand the language deeper. I offer very competitive rates at around £22/Hour for language sessions, and would advise you to the <a href="contact"><i>Contact Me</i></a> for more information, queries or bookings.</p><br>
