  <div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">It's time for a fresh voice to represent Redhill East at County. Someone that will modernise the way politics is done. Someone that understands that <i>you</i> fund the Council and that you wish to keep as much of your paycheque as possible. Someone that cares about delivering value for the services you fund through your hard-earned tax money.<br><br>I am super excited to announce that I am standing to represent Redhill East for Surrey in May of 2021. If you support my vision for building a better Surrey, please share my page with three people (or you can just like my facebook page if it's easier!). Vote LEHODEY for Redhill!</div>

  <div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">MY PLAN FOR SURREY</h2><p><b>Lower Taxes, Better Services</b> - It is your hard work that funds council services. I will ensure that residents keep as much of their income as possible by eliminating waste, closely scrutinising spending, and monitoring incentives to ensure that essential services continue to be delivered efficiently.<br><br>
	  <b>Building Back Better</b> - Everything from roads, libraries, schools, and planning, should be based not on theory or idealism, but according to the real-world uses and needs of the those using them. This means trusting people to know whatâ€™s best for them rather than imposing one way for all.<br><br>
	  <b>Championing Local Commerce</b> - Businesses are the lifeblood of our communities. By cutting bureaucracy and enabling entrepreneurship to flourish across Surrey, residents of Redhill will benefit from higher employment, stronger communities, and new opportunities for all. More small businesses to enjoy, whatâ€™s not to love?<br><br>  
	  <b>More Accessible Representation</b> - I will use technology to give residents a voice, creating an online portal where any resident of Redhill can submit suggestions, complaints, or feedback to myself as Councillor. I will also set up monthly surgeries for residents to chat about any local issues or comments.<br><br>
	  <b>A True Voice for Young People</b> - I will provide fresh ideas and a different perspective to improve our Council services for young people.<br><br></p></div>

  <div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">PROJECTS, and PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE</h2><p>
	  <b>A Community Figure</b> - As part of the Reigate and Banstead Youth Council, I have worked with many local charities and organisations to support our local community. This includes Surrey Drug and Alcohol Care, where we, as the Youth Council, fundraised and organised events to raise awareness for the important work of Surrey Drug and Alcohol Care. I also played an integral part in leading and organising our â€˜Big Youth Debateâ€™ in 2018 and 2017, where we encouraged debate on key issues to get Young People interested in Politics and local government. As Councillor, I would build on this by running events and continuing to speak to other Young People about the vital work that the Council does, as well as the importance of Politics as a subject.<br><br>
	  <b>Experience with Casework</b> - Currently working for an MP, I understand and have experience handling casework and policy issues. Residents could contact me by telephone, email, or social media.<br><br>
	  <b>Standing up for what's right</b> - So many politicians will work relentlessly towards something without ever having paused to consider if what their doing is morally right. As a scholar of history and philosophy, doing what's right is at the heart of my campaign.<br><br>
	  <b>Active in Reigate</b> - will build on my relationship with the Reigate Youth Council, which I have been a member of since 2015, to get young people more engaged and support local charities and organisations.

  <div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">WHY I AM THE RIGHT PERSON TO REPRESENT REDHILL EAST</h2><p>
  I am energetic, driven, and ambitious. My top priority is empowering the people of Surrey and creating new opportunities, and that I will do. I have shown through my previous experience that I have what it takes and am able to deliver. Most of all, I am always learning new things which means that the longer I serve, the better I will represent you. In the language of mathematics, the value I will bring to Redhill East is represented by the graph of e^x. ðŸ˜Ž <br>
