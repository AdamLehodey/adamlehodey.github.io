	<div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">Not only do I excel in what I do for myself, others are regularly pointing out the high-quality work I deliver across the board. The services I offer are all some of my specialities and are therefore delivered to the upmost quality, on-time and with support available on all products and services. These include tutoring, something which I am very much suited for, having taught languages to Primary School Children at St John’s School. My fantastic GCSE Grades of 10A*’s reflect my stellar knowledge of the content, and you are sure to see large improvements in everything you do. I also create fantastic and beautifully designed websites such as my own, created 100% from scratch and with no re-occurring fees other than domain registration, which is out of my control. Payments I accept include PayPal, WU, Cheque or Cash. Certainly ask any questions you may have using the Contact page, and I hope you find what you’re looking for!</p><br><br></div>

	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">TUTORING</h2><p>I have been offering Tutoring for almost three years, and offer a very wide range of grades at GCSE – including 10A*’s and a Grade 9 at English Literature GCSE. Having studied them myself, I know the courses inside out and am taking some of the subjects further at A-Level, giving me a wide range of contextual knowledge. I also have a large database of excellent resources which I can use, including revision notes and exam tips I have created to ensure success at GCSE. I offer very competitive rates at around £18/Hour, as well as group pricing, and am able to travel all around the Reigate and Banstead area. For more information or to book a session, please contact me via the <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> page.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">WEB DESIGN</h2><p>I have been creating fantastic websites such as this one for years, my first being in the Summer of 2013. I am able to use modern programming languages such as JavaScript and HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and more! My experience allows me to create truly amazing looking, modern and fluid websites such as my own. The websites I created are fitted to your needs and requirements, and include an online video chat to find out more about what you’d like your website to achieve and ways to make it work. For more information on the product, to get a quite or to find out more, please use the <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> section on my website.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">PROGRAMMING</h2><p>Programming is one of the things I dedicate my heart and soul to, and something I 100% enjoy, especially the thrill of completing a difficult challenge. I am offering programming services to companies and individuals needing specific programs or projects created for them, but am also able to complete testing and consulting on individual programs. I am at a Strong level in Java Programming, and am also very strong with SQL, HTML, CSS and more. Please <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> to get individual quotes or ask any questions.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">LANGUAGES</h2><p>Languages are one my favourites things, especially as I’m fluent in all three of Français, English and Español. This makes me very qualified to teach languages including French and Spanish, or English to foreign or domestic students who wish to improve their language skills. I am currently undertaking A-Levels in both French and Spanish, and have been speaking both French and English since birth, meaning that my services offer the ability to speak with a true French person and understand the language deeper. I offer very competitive rates at around £18/Hour for language sessions, and would advise you to the <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> for more information, queries or bookings.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT</h2><p>In today’s inter-connected world, the access to technology and social media is vital to almost every business and individual, allowing important connections between customers and businesses to develop. However, many businesses find managing social media extremely challenging, as it’s another thing to do in addition to the hundreds of other tasks which must be completed each day to keep the business running smoothly. It is for this reason which I am offering to manage the social media for small and medium sized businesses, as well as optimising their search results and using tools such as Facebook for Business to advertise and promote the business. To discover more, ask a question or anything else, please refer to the <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> section.</p><br><br>

	<h2 class="ContentTitles">COPYWRITING</h2><p>Copywriting involves creating content and promotional material for websites, emails, brochures and more! This is something I am extremely used to as I’ve been writing creatively and for purpose for years, having achieved a Grade 9/A* at GCSE English. I understand the importance of writing for a specific audience, what the audience are looking for and ways to appeal to that audience – something which I used in my Media Studies and Business studies, achieving A*’s in both! If you have anything you need created or any content material filled, I will be sure to do it at a reasonable and competitive price, and deliver the highest standards always. As always, please use the <a href="Contact.html"><i>Contact Me</i></a> section for enquiries, questions and more!</p><br><br>
