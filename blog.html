    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">EXCITING NEW PROJECT</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">24/02/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>After several weeks of being bogged down with endless mock exams, half term, and countless essays and assignments to write, I am now back with a new project I am working on. The project, An Employee Management Software for a company, is the next big thing I will be applying all the skills I acquire over computing to. The reason to why I have been looking less at Java was due to working on mySQL and getting really in-depth knowledge into that, which is something I will be working on all year. Now I understand all the fundamentals however, I am ready to start implementing this into my new project. This will keep track of different departments in an organisation and all their employees involved, as well as tracking attendance to work, bonuses, performance and special notes related to the employee. This is something which I would like to develop a nice GUI for, even though it is an area I am weak at. Therefore, working on this project for this half term will enable me to strengthen my GUI skills and think in-depth about Databases, inheritance, efficiency and more.</p>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">FINANCE SPRING SCHOOL</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">20/02/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
    <p>
      Over the past week, while many people spent their February half term on the other side of the world, on the beach and with their sunglasses down, I decided to stay in London, where the average temperature was 3°C. Not that it bothered me, since I was at one of the world’s greatest Universities, University College London, partaking in a Business and Finance spring school, which covered so many aspects of the Financial World and the things pathways you can take.<br><br>On the first day, we were greeted by UCL’s student ambassadors, which were extremely welcoming and friendly, and you really could talk to them as people. I made the most of the opportunity to talk to as many of them as possible and ask endless questions on University study and general questions on studying in London, all of which is proving to be incredibly helpful.<br><br>In regards to the finance side of things, we were put into groups, working on a  4 day project where we had to explore a particular area of the financial sector, the roles involves, the degree paths which you can take, and more. One thing which I found very intriguing was the number of degrees which allowed you to enter jobs in the Finance and The City, including things like Computer Science, Linguistics and Politics. This is something to keep in mind when choosing your degree, showing that what really matters in the industry are your people skills and your willingness to learn. I look forward to attending lots more University taster sessions, but meanwhile, this term I’m focusing 100% on my maths skills to achieve the A* and gain a place at an incredible university like UCL.</p>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">NEW BLOG</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">19/01/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>Welcome to my new programming blog, based on all the projects I am currently working on and what progress I've made each week. This first week, I have started getting really in depth with JavaFX, taking my Java skills to the next level by looking at UI and giving the users of my program a better experience!<br><br>To do so, I have been adapting a 'Theatre Ticketing System' which I created at home and started in CompSci lessons, and am working on the user inferface. Unfortunately, the implementation of the JavaFX classes has meant that the file read/write to Binary File is no longer working, but I will be looking into a solution. I've really gotten a strong hold on the MVC Progamming; Model, View, Controller, allowing you to separate the visual and functional aspects of your code and link them with a controller. The more I lean about this, the better my UI for the Theatre System will get.</p><br>
