    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">JAVAFX SHARES GAME</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">13/03/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>JavaFX. Once hated, now forever loved. I just can’t get enough of it! It all started on those infamous snow days, where I sat down and thought about the way I hadn’t practiced Java in almost a month! One thing I was very actively doing however was updating this blog, and so I decided to create a blog management system, as I’ve already mentioned. I couldn't just create it with a text based GUI as I normally did, since I would be the one using it and wanted it to be easy and faster than updating the source code manually. So, I started coding in JavaFX, watching various tutorials online and reading a book on the topic. As soon as I had finished, I know I had fallen in love with JavaFX.<br><br>This week, I have worked tirelessly to create my first real game and definitely my largest project. The aim of the game is to trade the shares and make a profit - quite simple really. The game gets progressively harder as the markets become more volatile, and you need to grow the starting balance of £1,000,000 as much as possible. One of the creative things I did was use HashMaps to map the line charts for each company onto the name, and then onto the one chart, rather than assigning all of them separately, allowing for greater expandability and flexibility when coding. I also was able to play around a lot with the layout, and created what I believe to be an intuitive and nice looking layout for the game, with information on share price, balance and more. If you’re looking to start coding in JavaFX, I recommend courses on YouTube or books from WHSmith.<br><br>One of the final challenges I faced was when I wanted to show my friends the project, only to realise they all needed to have the Java Runtime Environment installed for the Java ByteCode to be understood. Now I’m not sure about you, but if you asked 99% of people what the JRE is, they’d have no idea. So, I managed to package the whole application into one easily runnable .EXE file, in which I bundled the JRE for the application to run off natively, to distribute in one easy and installable package.<br><br>To download the program and take a look for yourself: <a id="Download" href="http://fileden.net/6g8?pt=hT%2FCy8TypmLeEcf9dGSBKKmFNhsVbT89xUhZqZIMTYk%3D">Shares Game Download (Windows)</a><br><br>Images:<br><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1520974980/MainMenu.jpg"><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1520974979/TradeFX.jpg"><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1520974979/TradeFX2.jpg"></p><br>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">BRILLIANT BLOG-MANAGEMENT PROJECT</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">02/03/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>Many of you may be unaware of this but I actually add blog posts by directly editing the source code of the site. While some of you may be thinking how amateurish that may be, worry not, as my latest Java Project is a blog management system. I have successfully set up an online database to host my blog content on, and have created a Java program to add new posts and view all current posts, which will edit the posts on my blog online - cutting out the tedious editing of the source code and making it a simple 'copy and paste' into a beautiful GUI.<br><br>This is my first real JavaFX project, but I definitely learnt a lot doing it - I'll definitely begin using JavaFX more in the future as it's really powerful!<br><br>Also, I've found a solution to the image problem where images in another folder weren't loading on the blog, and will begin loading blog images from an external source to speed up the page-load time. Some screenshots of the project include: <br><br><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1519995949/BlogManagerHome.jpg"><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1519995940/NewPost.jpg"><img class="BlogImage" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/adamlehodey/image/upload/v1519995951/ViewPosts.jpg"></p>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">RESPONSIVE VIDEO DESIGN</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">28/02/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>One of the main features you’ll notice about my website is the fluid, responsive design which works on all device sizes and keeps content flowing. When uploading videos to my blog, it was clear this was a problem as the native youtube embed gives you videos as a static size, so it overflows if ever you’re viewing on a mobile design. Here is the fix:<br><ol><li>Get the YouTube video you’d like to embed and copy the embed link, pasting it into where you’d like the content to go.<li>Create a separate div surrounding this, perhaps calling it ‘Content Box’ or ‘ContentWrapper’ - this div will serve to add padding to the bottom of the iframe to keep the aspect ratio the same.<li>Create an iframe selector for your iframe, with position absolute.<li>One issue I encountered was having a large amount of white space which was the padding underneath the video when size wasn’t set to 100%. Therefore, to fix this, create another div and set the max width to your height of video, but use the equivalent value in vw as the width varies less on devices. Then, clip the overflow.<li>You’re done!</ol><b>HTML</b><br>&ltdiv class="V-Blog">&ltdiv&gt class="Wrapper">&ltiframe&gt width="560" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/ayuooyWPEUc?t=30s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></&ltiframe&gt></&ltdiv&gt></&ltdiv&gt>&lt/iframe&gt&lt/div&gt&lt/div&gt<br><b>CSS</b><br>.Wrapper {position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%; padding-top: 25px; height: 0; overflow: clip;}

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">EXCITING NEW PROJECT</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">24/02/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>After several weeks of being bogged down with endless mock exams, half term, and countless essays and assignments to write, I am now back with a new project I am working on. The project, An Employee Management Software for a company, is the next big thing I will be applying all the skills I acquire over computing to. The reason to why I have been looking less at Java was due to working on mySQL and getting really in-depth knowledge into that, which is something I will be working on all year. Now I understand all the fundamentals however, I am ready to start implementing this into my new project. This will keep track of different departments in an organisation and all their employees involved, as well as tracking attendance to work, bonuses, performance and special notes related to the employee. This is something which I would like to develop a nice GUI for, even though it is an area I am weak at. Therefore, working on this project for this half term will enable me to strengthen my GUI skills and think in-depth about Databases, inheritance, efficiency and more.</p>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">FINANCE SPRING SCHOOL</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">20/02/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
    <p>
      Over the past week, while many people spent their February half term on the other side of the world, on the beach and with their sunglasses down, I decided to stay in London, where the average temperature was 3°C. Not that it bothered me, since I was at one of the world’s greatest Universities, University College London, partaking in a Business and Finance spring school, which covered so many aspects of the Financial World and the things pathways you can take.<br><br>On the first day, we were greeted by UCL’s student ambassadors, which were extremely welcoming and friendly, and you really could talk to them as people. I made the most of the opportunity to talk to as many of them as possible and ask endless questions on University study and general questions on studying in London, all of which is proving to be incredibly helpful.<br><br>In regards to the finance side of things, we were put into groups, working on a  4 day project where we had to explore a particular area of the financial sector, the roles involves, the degree paths which you can take, and more. One thing which I found very intriguing was the number of degrees which allowed you to enter jobs in the Finance and The City, including things like Computer Science, Linguistics and Politics. This is something to keep in mind when choosing your degree, showing that what really matters in the industry are your people skills and your willingness to learn. I look forward to attending lots more University taster sessions, but meanwhile, this term I’m focusing 100% on my maths skills to achieve the A* and gain a place at an incredible university like UCL.</p>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">NEW BLOG</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">19/01/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>Welcome to my new programming blog, based on all the projects I am currently working on and what progress I've made each week. This first week, I have started getting really in depth with JavaFX, taking my Java skills to the next level by looking at UI and giving the users of my program a better experience!<br><br>To do so, I have been adapting a 'Theatre Ticketing System' which I created at home and started in CompSci lessons, and am working on the user inferface. Unfortunately, the implementation of the JavaFX classes has meant that the file read/write to Binary File is no longer working, but I will be looking into a solution. I've really gotten a strong hold on the MVC Progamming; Model, View, Controller, allowing you to separate the visual and functional aspects of your code and link them with a controller. The more I lean about this, the better my UI for the Theatre System will get.</p><br>
