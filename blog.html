    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">EXCITING NEW PROJECT</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">26/01/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>This week, I've started the planning and initial design for a new project, all relating to mathematics! The project will involve solving and modelling difficult mathematical problems, including aspects from Analystics and Statistics using DataBases, Modelling with Quadratics, Expanding (a+bx)^y terms up to any point using binomial expansion, and using all other functions to complete things such as modelling using differentiation and finding the area under curves.<br><br>I was inspired to start this project through our Maths Key Assesment, which made me question in what ways I could incorporate both Maths and computing together to solve real world problems. One of the unique things about this project is that I am designing a fluent and beautiful graphical UI for users to interact with, creating a much better end project, including animations, through the use of JavaFX.<br><br>This week, I have created one of the base layers, the Binomial Expansion part of the project, which will work as a function, enabling other parts of the program such as harder modelling to work. By working this way, I am utilising some aspects of Functional Programming, using functions for abstraction. I have also worked on the user object and user login classes, which will allow users to keep notes and save their past answers to problems. In the following week, I will be working on a main class to start bringing together all these elements, and start work on the GUI, using MVC programming that I spoke about last week.<br>Screenshots for all the work I've done can be seen below.</p><img class="BlogImage" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cteGl4Fh49Qyy1sbj_YqOwgs9zhWYcAFtn6TzRtNw9JQQhBJvvB-i2IEE3MEpw2JjP7XqW0KkShNQTsbTk22=w1920-h974-rw" alt="Binomial UserInterface"><img class="BlogImage" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nvApSGyxcW2Clx4KULb4J6-Wz5V0ixAPs2NvWzurYXgtU5wXNOOGusGXNEOQAK4MlEPfeiociaz_ZID8se6B=w1920-h974" alt="Choose Function"><img class="BlogImage" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/sfU2KE_cKQh6RdLVNg7ECBX3MIH-MBz_lp7wNc64T1VEDiWDMfc_PuLLyVnKoPU8JdYz8LFA4AVl04_n_Ehv=w1920-h974-rw" alt="Login Class"><br>

    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">NEW BLOG</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">19/01/2018 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>Welcome to my new programming blog, based on all the projects I am currently working on and what progress I've made each week. This first week, I have started getting really in depth with JavaFX, taking my Java skills to the next level by looking at UI and giving the users of my program a better experience!<br><br>To do so, I have been adapting a 'Theatre Ticketing System' which I created at home and started in CompSci lessons, and am working on the user inferface. Unfortunately, the implementation of the JavaFX classes has meant that the file read/write to Binary File is no longer working, but I will be looking into a solution. I've really gotten a strong hold on the MVC Progamming; Model, View, Controller, allowing you to separate the visual and functional aspects of your code and link them with a controller. The more I lean about this, the better my UI for the Theatre System will get.</p><br>
