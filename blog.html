      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">ON MINIMALISM, PART ONE</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">22/11/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>When one uses the word ‘minimalist’, it generally causes others to imagine that you are living in an empty apartment with no furniture, you wear the same clothes every day, and limit your material possessions to one-hundred items. The connotations associated with the word <i>minimalist</i> are one of the reasons why people remain sceptical about adopting such a lifestyle. In this brief article, I would like to highlight some things that everyone can learn from minimalism, and while doing so, improve the health of the planet, save money, and become more productive. This is a two-part article, and both this week and the next, I will be giving one lesson on what everyone can learn from minimalism.<br><br>

        <u>Lesson #1 – Stop buying ‘stuff’ for the sake of it.</u><br><br>

        In my view, minimalism is not about owning a set number of items. Rather, it is about <i>mindfulness</i>, and only owning things that you truly value. While it is true that almost all items serve a purpose, one must consider at what point those items become counter-productive (the economists reading this will recognise this as being the law of diminishing returns). For example, whilst owning one pair of shoes is essential, owning thirty pairs of shoes is not. Consider what adds value to you, and discard the things that do not. If you were to look around your apartment now, looking through all your drawers, your bookshelves, your wardrobe, how many things would you see that you haven’t used within the past year? We hold on to our things for years in fear that we ‘might’ one day need them, though if these items disappeared, likely, you wouldn’t even know that they had disappeared. We hold onto so many pointless items: gifts that serve little purpose, textbooks that we may ‘one-day’ study, clothes that we got on ‘sale’ that we’ve worn once, thousands of papers and bills that we no longer need. By placing so much value on these items we feel that we never have enough. These items cause us stress. These items waste our time. When you get home, take at least 5 minutes to assess what items are fundamental in <i>your</i> life, and donate any items that no-longer serve sufficient purpose to justify the space that they occupy.<br><br>

        In today's consumerist society, where fast-fashion, fast-food, and quick consumption is king, it is easy to be persuaded by the hordes of advertising thrown at us by these large corporations. This Black Friday, resist the sales, which are pushing you to buy pointless things that you would never otherwise have bought by persuading you that you somehow ‘need’ them. If you need them, you would already own them. It is better to spend 3 times as much on items whose quality is 3 times better. Better for you, and better for the planet. This is not an essay on economics, but the incredible thing about our current economic system is that if enough people make this small change, companies will have to adapt to the market (at risk of going bankrupt), leading to a more sustainable economy.<br><br>

        My last point on this topic is that it is better not to buy something, and spend that money on experiences instead. The problem with <i>things</i> is that, while we may be happy with them for a limited period after purchasing them, that initial buzz we feel wears off fast. Think how excited you were when you first got your mobile phone or that item of clothing that you thought looked amazing when you tried it on. How do you feel about it today? It likely feels pretty normal. Another issue with <i>things</i> is that we always feel inadequate when comparing them. Even if you get the latest iPhone, a new one will come out just a few months later, and by definition, the one you own will no longer be the latest. Clothes will go out of fashion. Electronics become obsolete sooner than you think. You’ll lose some items – they could get stolen. Besides, even if you’ve saved for years to buy that car, watch, or wedding, there will always be someone that’s done it better. We should stop attempting to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ since it serves very little purpose. <i>Experiences</i>, on the other hand, have the opposite effect. The more time elapses since they occurred, the more you treasure them. Think back to your family holidays from when you were a child. Think back to your time at school or university and how the knowledge that you acquired shaped your perception of the world. Experiences and knowledge (what Sociologists or economists might call your <i>human capital</i>) are things that no-one can take away from you. They stay will you forever, unlike the temporary nature of <i>things</i>. So next time you’re about to make that impulse purchase then consider, do I <i>really</i> need this? Is it the <i>best</i> use of my money? The answer will probably be no.</p>

      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">THE CASE FOR CAPITALISM: AN ESSAY</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">02/10/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>For the past 100 years, it seems that nothing has dominated Western culture more than the ‘battle of ideas between Capitalism and Socialism. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when it seemed that Capitalism was well and truly the <i>vainqueur</i>, we have seen the resurgence of what the left calls ‘Democratic Socialism’ in recent years. With a shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer who openly admits to following the Marxist Doctrine, and the rise of figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the US, it is more important than ever to dig deeper and look at the fundamentals and workings of both systems, in order to make an informed decision that will maximise growth and prosperity.<br><br>

       One important difference between Capitalism and Socialism (whether dictatorial, such as in the USSR, or ‘democratic’, such as in France and Post-War Britain before the 1980s) is the way in which resources are utilised. This is an important thing to note, since in essence, an economic system is just a way of managing scarce resources. Whether one lives in a capitalist or socialist society, there are finite amounts of resources and labour available, so the countries that prosper are those that make the most efficient use of those resources. That is the reason why Britain and the world today is many thousands of times wealthier than it was in the middle-ages, despite having the same amount of resources available in both eras. Under a capitalist system, goods will always flow to their most efficient use through the use of prices. The result of this is as follows: the price of goods that are scarce will increase, leading to more attractive profits, so more companies will enter the market and start producing those goods, causing the prices to decrease as one firm undercuts the other. If a business is not using its resources in the most efficient way, another firm, with better use of resources, will be able to enter the industry and produce those goods at a lower cost, perhaps with less-waste, or through increasing output per worker. Other firms will either have to adapt, or risk losing business and becoming bankrupt. Losses and bankruptcies play a role that is equally as important as profits, as it prevents resources being used inefficiently. The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that it is similar to the process of evolution and Darwinism, whereby the weakest species (companies) are eliminated, leading to a more robust population (economy) overall. If you are interested in learning more, I would highly recommend the book ‘Knowledge and Decisions’, by Thomas Sowell. <br><br>

        Under a socialist system, such as that proposed by the labour government, where firms are under the ownership of the state, profits are eliminated, which contrary to what one may believe, benefits no-one. This is because the firms involved are shielded from losses, and so may continue to operate in a manner that is less efficient than in a free-market. It leads to a removal of incentives to innovate and deliver better services, as was the case under British rail (the state owned rail company, before the rail was privatised under the franchising system), where trains were often late, dirty, and inefficient. It is for this reason that capitalism drives innovation and creates real wealth, that the wealthiest countries are also the freest. This is the case with the United States, UK, Hong-Kong, and even China, after having embraced the free-market. According to the FT, by cutting red-tape and reducing bureaucracy, China moved up 30 places to become the 46th easiest place to do business. On the contrary, it is no surprise that all Socialist countries have either failed or had to move towards the free-market; the USSR, Britain in the ‘70s, India in the ‘90s, and many more countries have moved towards economic liberation and a more efficient free-market approach.<br><br>

        Finally, I would like to address the problem of ‘externalities’ and other problems in the market, which does in some cases justify the role of the state. In recent times especially, there have been calls for Socialism and a ‘Green New Deal’ to deal with global warming and the problem of climate change. The Guardian, a left-leaning newspaper, published an article in 2018 headlined ‘Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism’. When we assess the facts however, we find that this is in fact not the case, and our best tool for dealing with pollution is in fact Capitalism. Innovations in green-technologies such as electric cars and solar panels are not the result of the state, and are only possible because the efficient use of resources under Capitalism means that we can devote more time to research and development, than ploughing the fields, as this is the most efficient use of goods and resources. It is Capitalism that we have to thank for closing polluting and inefficient coal-mines and for innovations in computer science, which means that rather than having 10 devices and endless amounts of paper, almost anything can be done through smartphones. The truth is that under capitalism, if the public are not happy with firms that pollute or use excessive amounts of plastics, they can simply choose not to support those firms, which will lead them to either adapt, or go bankrupt (unless, through special government favours or laws, they have a monopoly in that area which other firms are prevented from breaking). It is this that has led to Amazon announcing that they will purchase 10,000 ‘electric’ delivery trucks, that has led supermarkets to reduce plastic waste, and that has led to companies such as BP and Shell to invest more and more in renewable sources.<br><br>

      One thing that seems clear to me is that on both sides of the debate, people passionately believe that they are fighting for the ‘moral’ and ‘correct’ way of doing things. It is a complicated debate, but I would urge you to consider historical evidence and the incentives created when politicians announce their aims. The elimination of profits through state of ownership may sound nice in theory, but what this leads to is not ownership by the people, but ownership by a small group with vested interests in preserving the status-quo. If you are interested in learning more about the topic, I would highly recommend Sowell’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730/ref=dp_ob_image_bk">‘Basic Economics’</a> textbook, which provides a fantastic explanation of these key concepts, or if you prefer something lighter, I suggest watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBuns9Evn1w-5rkmBNwtfL58cx6D9irhc">‘Stossel on…’</a>series by ReasonTV on Youtube, which provide short, 5 minute videos on many topics.</p>
