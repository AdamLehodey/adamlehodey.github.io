    <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">THE CASE FOR CAPITALISM: AN ESSAY</h2>
    <div class="PostInfo">02/10/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
      <p>For the past 100 years, it seems that nothing has dominated Western culture more than the ‘battle of ideas between Capitalism and Socialism. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when it seemed that Capitalism was well and truly the <i>vainqueur</i>, we have seen the resurgence of what the left calls ‘Democratic Socialism’ in recent years. With a shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer who openly admits to following the Marxist Doctrine, and the rise of figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the US, it is more important than ever to dig deeper and look at the fundamentals and workings of both systems, in order to make an informed decision that will maximise growth and prosperity.

One important difference between Capitalism and Socialism (whether dictatorial, such as in the USSR, or ‘democratic’, such as in France and Post-War Britain before the 1980s) is the way in which resources are utilised. This is an important thing to note, since in essence, an economic system is just a way of managing scarce resources. Whether one lives in a capitalist or socialist society, there are finite amounts of resources and labour available, so the countries that prosper are those that make the most efficient use of those resources. That is the reason why Britain and the world today is many thousands of times wealthier than it was in the stone-age, despite having the same amount of resources available in both eras. Under a capitalist system, goods will always flow to their most efficient use through the use of prices. The result of this is as follows: the price of goods that are scarce will increase, leading to more attractive profits, so more companies will enter the market and start producing those goods, causing the prices to decrease as one firm undercuts the other. If a business is not using its resources in the most efficient way, another firm, with better use of resources, will be able to enter the industry and produce those goods at a lower cost, perhaps with less-waste, or through increasing output per worker. Other firms will either have to adapt, or risk losing business and becoming bankrupt. Losses and bankruptcies play a role that is equally as important as profits, as it prevents resources being used inefficiently. The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that it is similar to the process of evolution and Darwinism, whereby the weakest species (companies) are eliminated, leading to a more robust population (economy) overall. If you are interested in learning more, I would highly recommend the book ‘Knowledge and Decisions’, by Thomas Sowell. <br><br>

Under a socialist system, such as that proposed by the labour government, where firms are under the ownership of the state, profits are eliminated, which contrary to what one may believe, benefits no-one. This is because the firms involved are shielded from losses, and so may continue to operate in a manner that is less efficient than in a free-market. It leads to a removal of incentives to innovate and deliver better services, as was the case under British rail (the state owned rail company, before the rail was privatised under the franchising system), where trains were often late, dirty, and inefficient. It is for this reason that capitalism drives innovation and creates real wealth, that the wealthiest countries are also the freest. This is the case with the United States, UK, Hong-Kong, and even China, after having embraced the free-market. According to the FT, by cutting red-tape and reducing bureaucracy, China moved up 30 places to become the 46th easiest place to do business. On the contrary, it is no surprise that all Socialist countries have either failed or had to move towards the free-market; the USSR, Britain in the ‘70s, India in the ‘90s, and many more countries have moved towards economic liberation and a more efficient free-market approach.<br><br>

Finally, I would like to address the problem of ‘externalities’ and other problems in the market, which does in some cases justify the role of the state. In recent times especially, there have been calls for Socialism and a ‘Green New Deal’ to deal with global warming and the problem of climate change. The Guardian, a left-leaning newspaper, published an article in 2018 headlined ‘Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism’. When we assess the facts however, we find that this is in fact not the case, and our best tool for dealing with pollution is in fact Capitalism. Innovations in green-technologies such as electric cars and solar panels are not the result of the state, and are only possible because the efficient use of resources under Capitalism means that we can devote more time to research and development, than ploughing the fields, as this is the most efficient use of goods and resources. It is Capitalism that we have to thank for closing polluting and inefficient coal-mines and for innovations in computer science, which means that rather than having 10 devices and endless amounts of paper, almost anything can be done through smartphones. The truth is that under capitalism, if the public are not happy with firms that pollute or use excessive amounts of plastics, they can simply choose not to support those firms, which will lead them to either adapt, or go bankrupt (unless, through special government favours or laws, they have a monopoly in that area which other firms are prevented from breaking). It is this that has led to Amazon announcing that they will purchase 10,000 ‘electric’ delivery trucks, that has led supermarkets to reduce plastic waste, and that has led to companies such as BP and Shell to invest more and more in renewable sources.<br><br>

One thing that seems clear to me is that on both sides of the debate, people passionately believe that they are fighting for the ‘moral’ and ‘correct’ way of doing things. It is a complicated debate, but I would urge you to consider historical evidence and the incentives created when politicians announce their aims. The elimination of profits through state of ownership may sound nice in theory, but what this leads to is not ownership by the people, but ownership by a small group with vested interests in preserving the status-quo. If you are interested in learning more about the topic, I would highly recommend Sowell’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730/ref=dp_ob_image_bk">‘Basic Economics’</a> textbook, which provides a fantastic explanation of these key concepts, or if you prefer something lighter, I suggest watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBuns9Evn1w-5rkmBNwtfL58cx6D9irhc">‘Stossel on…’</a> series by ReasonTV on Youtube, which provide short, 5 minute videos on many topics.</p>
