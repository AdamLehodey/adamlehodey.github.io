      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">ON MINIMALISM, PART TWO - DIGITAL MINIMALISM</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">30/10/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>Last week, I outlined some ways in which our lives can be improved if each of us takes a small step in being more mindful in our purchases, and in the physical items that we own. This week, I would like to show you the ways in which I apply the principles of minimalism to my digital life, and how you can too. I have always liked to keep my devices as organised as possible, using logical file structures and file names, and discarding documents I no-longer needed. It was, however, precisely one year ago that I started to think more about the actual use of my devices, and that I took the radical step of purchasing a basic feature phone to use in my daily life (rather than my smartphone). One year on, I can honestly say that I couldn’t be happier with the decision that I’ve taken. Not once have I felt an urge to go back to my smartphone, and the time I save from not checking email 5 times a day, from not scrolling through pointless social media feeds that we all forget anyways, and from not having distracting notifications about trivial things when I am working, has been incredible. I understand it is not something for everyone, but I would encourage you to try it for at least one-month. Here are some other, perhaps less drastic steps you can take to boost your productivity and use technology more mindfully. Many of these ideas come from having read Cal Newport’s ‘Digital Minimalism’, which is a brilliant read!<br><br>

        <u>Lesson #1 – Turn off all your notifications, or delete social media off your phone altogether</u><br><br>

        Notifications are the number one enemy when trying to focus on a task. Picture this: You’re trying to work on an essential project that you’ve been putting off for weeks. This could be anything, a work project, a maths question sheet, an essay, etc. You’ve finally cleared 2 hours of your time to work on it, and you’re twenty minutes into the project, and just as you’re getting into it and you’ve gotten focussed… PING. You’re iPhone just went off with an Amazon notification informing you that there’s 20% off dishwasher tablets this weekend. This has happened to everyone, and studies have shown that it takes around 20 minutes to get to an optimum level of concentration when working on a task. This is not just related to work however, whether at the dinner table with your family, whilst driving, or on a dinner date, notifications – most of them pointless – break our flow and our conversation. Worse, studies have shown that just the presence of a mobile phone on a table, even without the screen being on, reduces your brain power, as outlined in this Atlantic article.<br><br>

        To fight against this, turn notifications from every app except calls and texts. If you’re sceptical then try it for a week and see what a huge difference it makes. The truth is that very few people care if you respond to their Snapchat messages a few hours later, and if something is that urgent that you must know at that moment, the message will find another way of getting to you, so there is no need to worry. Even better would be to delete Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn from your phone altogether, and use exclusively the website equivalents on your laptop at home. Not having social media everywhere that you go will give you a new sense of freedom, and will free-up your time for things that truly matter to you.<br><br>

        <u>Lesson #2 – Be mindful about the applications and files on your devices</u><br><br>

        More applications mean more time spent on your phone. If you’re anything like the average Brit (the definition of average means that you probably are), you spend 4 hours/day on your mobile phone alone. Add to that the time spent consuming YouTube and browsing Netflix on other devices, and you’ll find that you’re spending 1/3 of your day consuming content. Although some of it is no-doubt useful, most of it is not. No-one remembers, or cares, what they saw on Instagram 5 years ago, and you won’t remember what you’ve seen on Facebook today 5 years from now. We all have projects that we’ve been putting off for ‘one-day’. You’ll always be able to think of credible explanations of why today just isn’t the day to start. However, the truth is that if you want to achieve anything worthwhile in life, you must get out of your comfort zone. Leave your phone at home at head to the library or to a café to work on your project, distraction-free.<br><br>

        As the great Stoic Seneca once said: “It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.” The lesson we can learn from this is that if we want to make the most of the incredible gift of life, we must be mindful and try to always spend our time on what is most valuable. Only you know what truly matters to you.<br><br>

        <u>Lesson #3 – Block schedule your day to make the most of your technology usage</u><br><br>

        It is undeniable that technology and social media do have many advantages. Without the internet, you wouldn’t even be reading this article! However, to leverage technology as much as possible, use a technique called ‘block scheduling’. This is the process of planning out your day beforehand, and allotting a fixed amount of time and no-more to social media and other use of technology. For instance, saying that you will check your social media from 6-7pm, and only 6-7pm, means that you can be completely concentrated on that task, and your other tasks throughout the day. Whilst you may be spending the same amount of time checking social media, your other tasks that you’ll be completing throughout the day, without the distraction of social media, will be completed either faster or to a higher standard. Even your social media use will become more mindful, you will focus on the content that is truly important as you know that you have set a 1-hour limit on your social media usage. This works for many tasks: e-mail, telephone calls, and even tasks that are not digital such as cleaning. Using this method will greatly improve your productivity throughout the day, just by planning for 5 minutes in the morning.

      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">INSIDE AMAZON</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">29/10/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>When I picked up Brad Stone’s biography of Jeff Bezos in the early autumn of 2019, I was unaware of what an incredible giant Amazon really was. After having read it however, I was sure that the Amazon business model was the future – so much so that on Monday, I travelled all the way to Tilbury in Essex to tour their immense ‘fulfilment centre’ (FC), the second largest one in the world! Upon arrival, it felt like I had teleported to the year 2100.<br><br>
        
        To understand how Amazon got so big, one must only look back 25 years to 1994, where Jeff Bezos, currently the richest man on Earth, quit his Wall Street job to create the start-up we now know as Amazon. This was a time where the internet was a very niche thing: in a survey conducted by the International Telecommunications Union, only 4% of Americans reported having used the internet at that period. It may be precisely because Bezos got in so early, and hence had a first mover advantage, that Amazon is what it is today while thousands of other companies went bankrupt in the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. From there on, it was all growth. Whilst at first, the company was focused solely on selling books, it quickly expanded into new markets such as video and DVD, CDs, toys, and more. Today, Amazon sells almost every product imaginable. What makes Amazon so remarkable is the efficiency that it applies in every area of its business. Love it or hate it, that is how the firm is able to undercut its competitors, and is what has allowed the firm to negotiate such large economies of scale. The FC that I visited had over 10,000 robots operating in it, with clever algorithms moving the millions of items right where they need to be for an employee to pick and package them. What is surprising is that, while you may expect these robots to be taking the jobs of humans, the fulfilment centres that are automated actually require <i>more</i> staff, due to the FC being three times more efficient. At Amazon’s FC in Tilbury, there were almost 5000 members of staff. It is this innovation, frugality, and efficiency that has led Amazon to dominate online, and increasingly offline shopping. Whilst many may complain that Amazon is causing smaller shops to close-down, what we are actually witnessing are the inner-workings of Capitalism. The saying ‘adapt or die’ could not be more relevant. Whilst it is easy to complain about ‘large’ and ‘impersonal’ corporations, Amazon’s mission is clear: the consumer comes first. This has inevitably led to shops with bad customer service or excessive prices losing business, and rightly so! Where businesses have not gone bankrupt, they have had to adapt. Bookshops have had to cut their bloated profit margins (the other day, a book I was interested in was on sale for £25 at Waterstones, and only £12 on Amazon! It’s clear where I bought it from), or improve their service significantly to compete. This here demonstrates that Amazon’s innovation has benefited even the customers which have never shopped at Amazon!<br><br>
        
        You may or may not know this, but Amazon truly is immense. Not only does it operate in over 16 countries worldwide, it also purchased the supermarket chain Wholefoods in an attempt to enter the physical grocery market. Its physical stores are by no means limited to Wholefoods though – the company has been experimenting with a new concept store known as Amazon Go – famous for having no check-outs and enabling customers to ‘just walk out’ with their purchases. This is made possible using thousands of lasers, weight detectors on the shelf, and the use of Artificial Intelligence. The company has been expanding rapidly, with 18 already in operation, and there are plans to open over 3000 locations in the US and United Kingdom. Not only is Amazon a giant in retail, it also has a huge presence in the Cloud-Computing sector with AWS, the thing that powers Netflix, parts of the CIA, Adobe, and more. It is estimated that 5% of the web runs on AWS alone. Whilst the media loves to mock Amazon for its ‘appalling’ working conditions, the reality is not what you would expect. From what I could see (it’s possible, though I would argue unlikely, that Amazon gave me a tour similar to that seen in the film ‘The Interview’, where the protagonists travelling to North Korea were shown what was effectively a movie set), all employees were treated well, with their wages set at £11 an hour and doubling to £22 an hour for overtime and night shifts. They are treated to private healthcare, private dental treatment, and I’m sure that they also receive a nice discount on Amazon’s products. While the job may be boring at times, it is hardly the back-breaking labour and terrible conditions described in Orwell’s '<i>Road to Wigan Pier</i>'. If this is what the future of blue collar work looks like, then we've honestly come a very long way.<br><br>
        
        Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed being invited to tour Amazon’s Fulfilment centre, and it was captivating to see the workings behind the Western World’s largest e-commerce business. From both Brad Stone’s biography of Bezos, ‘The Everything Store’, and the tour of the FC, I was left with the impression that the firm truly was at the forefront of innovation, and was open to taking risks in things such as AI and hierarchical structures. This is why Amazon dominates the many industries it operates in, for now at least.</p></div>

      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">ON MINIMALISM, PART ONE</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">22/11/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>When one uses the word ‘minimalist’, it generally causes others to imagine that you are living in an empty apartment with no furniture, you wear the same clothes every day, and limit your material possessions to one-hundred items. The connotations associated with the word <i>minimalist</i> are one of the reasons why people remain sceptical about adopting such a lifestyle. In this brief article, I would like to highlight some things that everyone can learn from minimalism, and while doing so, improve the health of the planet, save money, and become more productive. This is a two-part article, and both this week and the next, I will be giving one lesson on what everyone can learn from minimalism.<br><br>

        <u>Lesson #1 – Stop buying ‘stuff’ for the sake of it.</u><br><br>

        In my view, minimalism is not about owning a set number of items. Rather, it is about <i>mindfulness</i>, and only owning things that you truly value. While it is true that almost all items serve a purpose, one must consider at what point those items become counter-productive (the economists reading this will recognise this as being the law of diminishing returns). For example, whilst owning one pair of shoes is essential, owning thirty pairs of shoes is not. Consider what adds value to you, and discard the things that do not. If you were to look around your apartment now, looking through all your drawers, your bookshelves, your wardrobe, how many things would you see that you haven’t used within the past year? We hold on to our things for years in fear that we ‘might’ one day need them, though if these items disappeared, likely, you wouldn’t even know that they had disappeared. We hold onto so many pointless items: gifts that serve little purpose, textbooks that we may ‘one-day’ study, clothes that we got on ‘sale’ that we’ve worn once, thousands of papers and bills that we no longer need. By placing so much value on these items we feel that we never have enough. These items cause us stress. These items waste our time. When you get home, take at least 5 minutes to assess what items are fundamental in <i>your</i> life, and donate any items that no-longer serve sufficient purpose to justify the space that they occupy.<br><br>

        In today's consumerist society, where fast-fashion, fast-food, and quick consumption is king, it is easy to be persuaded by the hordes of advertising thrown at us by these large corporations. This Black Friday, resist the sales, which are pushing you to buy pointless things that you would never otherwise have bought by persuading you that you somehow ‘need’ them. If you need them, you would already own them. It is better to spend 3 times as much on items whose quality is 3 times better. Better for you, and better for the planet. This is not an essay on economics, but the incredible thing about our current economic system is that if enough people make this small change, companies will have to adapt to the market (at risk of going bankrupt), leading to a more sustainable economy.<br><br>

        My last point on this topic is that it is better not to buy something, and spend that money on experiences instead. The problem with <i>things</i> is that, while we may be happy with them for a limited period after purchasing them, that initial buzz we feel wears off fast. Think how excited you were when you first got your mobile phone or that item of clothing that you thought looked amazing when you tried it on. How do you feel about it today? It likely feels pretty normal. Another issue with <i>things</i> is that we always feel inadequate when comparing them. Even if you get the latest iPhone, a new one will come out just a few months later, and by definition, the one you own will no longer be the latest. Clothes will go out of fashion. Electronics become obsolete sooner than you think. You’ll lose some items – they could get stolen. Besides, even if you’ve saved for years to buy that car, watch, or wedding, there will always be someone that’s done it better. We should stop attempting to ‘keep up with the Joneses’ since it serves very little purpose. <i>Experiences</i>, on the other hand, have the opposite effect. The more time elapses since they occurred, the more you treasure them. Think back to your family holidays from when you were a child. Think back to your time at school or university and how the knowledge that you acquired shaped your perception of the world. Experiences and knowledge (what Sociologists or economists might call your <i>human capital</i>) are things that no-one can take away from you. They stay will you forever, unlike the temporary nature of <i>things</i>. So next time you’re about to make that impulse purchase then consider, do I <i>really</i> need this? Is it the <i>best</i> use of my money? The answer will probably be no.</p>

      <div class="BlogPost"><h2 class="ContentTitle">THE CASE FOR CAPITALISM: AN ESSAY</h2>
      <div class="PostInfo">02/10/2019 // ADAM LEHODEY</div>
        <p>For the past 100 years, it seems that nothing has dominated Western culture more than the ‘battle of ideas between Capitalism and Socialism. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, when it seemed that Capitalism was well and truly the <i>vainqueur</i>, we have seen the resurgence of what the left calls ‘Democratic Socialism’ in recent years. With a shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer who openly admits to following the Marxist Doctrine, and the rise of figures such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in the US, it is more important than ever to dig deeper and look at the fundamentals and workings of both systems, in order to make an informed decision that will maximise growth and prosperity.<br><br>

       One important difference between Capitalism and Socialism (whether dictatorial, such as in the USSR, or ‘democratic’, such as in France and Post-War Britain before the 1980s) is the way in which resources are utilised. This is an important thing to note, since in essence, an economic system is just a way of managing scarce resources. Whether one lives in a capitalist or socialist society, there are finite amounts of resources and labour available, so the countries that prosper are those that make the most efficient use of those resources. That is the reason why Britain and the world today is many thousands of times wealthier than it was in the middle-ages, despite having the same amount of resources available in both eras. Under a capitalist system, goods will always flow to their most efficient use through the use of prices. The result of this is as follows: the price of goods that are scarce will increase, leading to more attractive profits, so more companies will enter the market and start producing those goods, causing the prices to decrease as one firm undercuts the other. If a business is not using its resources in the most efficient way, another firm, with better use of resources, will be able to enter the industry and produce those goods at a lower cost, perhaps with less-waste, or through increasing output per worker. Other firms will either have to adapt, or risk losing business and becoming bankrupt. Losses and bankruptcies play a role that is equally as important as profits, as it prevents resources being used inefficiently. The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that it is similar to the process of evolution and Darwinism, whereby the weakest species (companies) are eliminated, leading to a more robust population (economy) overall. If you are interested in learning more, I would highly recommend the book ‘Knowledge and Decisions’, by Thomas Sowell. <br><br>

        Under a socialist system, such as that proposed by the labour government, where firms are under the ownership of the state, profits are eliminated, which contrary to what one may believe, benefits no-one. This is because the firms involved are shielded from losses, and so may continue to operate in a manner that is less efficient than in a free-market. It leads to a removal of incentives to innovate and deliver better services, as was the case under British rail (the state owned rail company, before the rail was privatised under the franchising system), where trains were often late, dirty, and inefficient. It is for this reason that capitalism drives innovation and creates real wealth, that the wealthiest countries are also the freest. This is the case with the United States, UK, Hong-Kong, and even China, after having embraced the free-market. According to the FT, by cutting red-tape and reducing bureaucracy, China moved up 30 places to become the 46th easiest place to do business. On the contrary, it is no surprise that all Socialist countries have either failed or had to move towards the free-market; the USSR, Britain in the ‘70s, India in the ‘90s, and many more countries have moved towards economic liberation and a more efficient free-market approach.<br><br>

        Finally, I would like to address the problem of ‘externalities’ and other problems in the market, which does in some cases justify the role of the state. In recent times especially, there have been calls for Socialism and a ‘Green New Deal’ to deal with global warming and the problem of climate change. The Guardian, a left-leaning newspaper, published an article in 2018 headlined ‘Ending climate change requires the end of capitalism’. When we assess the facts however, we find that this is in fact not the case, and our best tool for dealing with pollution is in fact Capitalism. Innovations in green-technologies such as electric cars and solar panels are not the result of the state, and are only possible because the efficient use of resources under Capitalism means that we can devote more time to research and development, than ploughing the fields, as this is the most efficient use of goods and resources. It is Capitalism that we have to thank for closing polluting and inefficient coal-mines and for innovations in computer science, which means that rather than having 10 devices and endless amounts of paper, almost anything can be done through smartphones. The truth is that under capitalism, if the public are not happy with firms that pollute or use excessive amounts of plastics, they can simply choose not to support those firms, which will lead them to either adapt, or go bankrupt (unless, through special government favours or laws, they have a monopoly in that area which other firms are prevented from breaking). It is this that has led to Amazon announcing that they will purchase 10,000 ‘electric’ delivery trucks, that has led supermarkets to reduce plastic waste, and that has led to companies such as BP and Shell to invest more and more in renewable sources.<br><br>

      One thing that seems clear to me is that on both sides of the debate, people passionately believe that they are fighting for the ‘moral’ and ‘correct’ way of doing things. It is a complicated debate, but I would urge you to consider historical evidence and the incentives created when politicians announce their aims. The elimination of profits through state of ownership may sound nice in theory, but what this leads to is not ownership by the people, but ownership by a small group with vested interests in preserving the status-quo. If you are interested in learning more about the topic, I would highly recommend Sowell’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730/ref=dp_ob_image_bk">‘Basic Economics’</a> textbook, which provides a fantastic explanation of these key concepts, or if you prefer something lighter, I suggest watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBuns9Evn1w-5rkmBNwtfL58cx6D9irhc">‘Stossel on…’</a>series by ReasonTV on Youtube, which provide short, 5 minute videos on many topics.</p>
