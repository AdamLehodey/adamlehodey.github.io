	<div class="Intro"><p class="Buscar">It's been a difficult time to be a student. With self-isolation and coronavirus dominating much of the past two years, the extra hours you put into your studies outside of the classroom have now become more important than ever. My tutoring is unique: you'll approach the subject in a way that teaches not just the course, but the whole context surrounding the subject so that you can truly understand it. I know what A-Levels and GCSE's are like, having completed mine only a couple of years ago, and so I understand the problems you might face and will assist with teaching the course in an intuitive manner. I'll focus on teaching the subject for it's own sake, as opposed to just teaching how to pass the exam - though I'll of course also demonstrate how to excel at exam technique and how to tailor your answers to show the examiner what he is looking for.<br><br>My tutoring is not like the rest: you will enjoy learning the subject and understand why it's so useful and exciting. My energy and charisma means saying goodbye to the days of falling asleep in lessons: these are lessons you'll want to stay awake for. The tutoring I will offer for both GCSE and A-Levels, as well as that for university applications, will be one of the best investments you can make.</p></div>

	<div class="Content"><h2 class="ContentTitles">UCAS Personal Statement</h2><p>Applying for university can be daunting. It's also become increasingly competitive to get into the nation's top instutitions - with many having had many hours of practice writing personal statements and doing interviews.<br><br>

	Having received offers from a number of prestigious universities (<i>University College London, the LSE, Durham University, Warwick, King's College London, and SciencesPo and Columbia University in the US, where I have chosen to study</i>), I know what it takes to write a strong personal statement and to secure a place at a top Russell Group or Ivy League institution. I will guide you through the whole process: the 'super-curricular' activities you should be doing to enhance your application, deadlines to keep in mind, I will assist with helping you choose the right course, and of course, I'll guide you through every step of writing your personal statement.<br><br>If you are applying to Oxbridge or to the Ivy League I will assist with preparation for entrance examinations, and with regards to US applications, with the SAT, with navigating the CollegeBoard platform, applications for financial aid, and other tips for applying as an international student, having done so and been successful myself.<br><br>I will then provide mock-interviews and ensure you have everything you need to succeed. This is an investment that will be well worth it and will help you get way ahead of your peers. <br><br>The rate for a one hour session is £35 (minimum of five sessions), prices are negotiable. Alternatively, I can give feedback, improve and annotate three drafts of your personal statement for £110.
