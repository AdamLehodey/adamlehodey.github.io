It's also become increasingly competitive to get into the nation's top instutitions - with many having had many hours of practice writing personal statements and doing interviews.

	Having received offers from a number of prestigious universities (<i>University College London, the LSE, Durham University, Warwick, King's College London, and SciencesPo and Columbia University in the US, where I have chosen to study.</i>), I know what it takes to write a strong personal statement and to secure a place at a top institution. I will guide you through the whole process: the 'super-curricular' activities you should be doing to enhance your application, the ways in which you should word your statement, I will assist with helping you choose the write course, and of course, I'll guide you through every step of writing your personal statement.<br><br>The rate for a one hour session is £30.
